# My-Video-Projects
My name is Khadka Prasad Sharma, and I am currently living in Nepal. I work as a content creator and video editor. I mainly use editing software such as Canva, Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, CapCut, VSDC, Kinemaster, VN, and Filmora. Since I am a content creator, I will be sharing materials and works related to this field from now on.
